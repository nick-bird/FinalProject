## Project Emmy: Non-verbal Communication Platform
### Contributors: Justin Adams, Karen Mena, Tylor Shearn, Nick Bird

Project Emmy is a free and customizable tool for non-verbal communication. A family member or caretaker of the user creates an account, and has the ability to create new 'Expressions', words or phrases associated with a certain image which will be familiar to the user. These expresions can then be added to a User's Soundboards, which allow for organization of expressions based on category and so forth.

#### Technologies Used
Project Emmy uses a MySQL database, and a Java REST backend consisting of JPA/Hibernate with Spring Boot.  The user interface is written in Typescript using Angular with Bootstrap integration. The text-to-speech functionality is implemented using an external API provided by Voice RSS.
